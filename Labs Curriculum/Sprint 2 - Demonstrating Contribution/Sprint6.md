# Sprint Challenge: Sprint 6

**This is very similar to sprint 2, but your answers should focus on features from release 2**



## Objectives

- Student can articulate their delivery process in contributing to and completing individual tasks.
- Student can demonstrate, in detail, how their solution relates to the specification and architectural standards.
- Student can articulate the challenges and lessons learned from managing their time working on a complex project in a team.

## Prompt 1 - Communicating Individual Contribution

On the job, you will be responsible for shipping features regularly. Engineers are given tickets and are expected to deliver them. Hiring managers want to see that you are capable of delivering a feature.

Here are some examples of hiring manager interview questions:

- "Tell me about a project you've built."
- "What were some technical challenges on that project? How did you overcome them?"

We took these questions and cooked them into your labs experience. This week, you should have shipped at least one feature. Answer the following questions like you would in an interview:

### Questions you need to answer

1. Describe something you have built in the last 6 weeks. Link the relevant pull requests or paste screenshots of code. 
	Basically for last 6 weeks we build a lot, almost everything done, just need some improvements and Map visualization

2. How does what you built contribute to the overall product your team is building? What user problems does it help solve?

	So far during this project my contribution in this project as a team member was building admin console, map visualization, adding data set styling, design, Auth console etc.

3. Describe your delivery process for what you built this week from ideation to breakdown to implementation. What challenges occurred during the delivery process that you didn't foresee? Explain your technical solution in detail.

	This week was challenged week, this week I have working on Login staff, improving fixing previous mistakes, analyzing new data set and actually improving step by step 	

## Prompt 2 - Communicating Teamwork

As a software developer, you will almost always be on a team. As a result, engineering hiring managers want to see how you work on a team. As a junior developer, you will often pair with seniors on features. Here are some examples of interview questions you may get asked concerning teamwork:

- "Tell me about a time you worked on a team. What was hard about it?"
- "What is your greatest weakness as a team player? How have you improved?"

This week we taught you how to pair with other team members. You should have worked with at least one other person to deliver a feature. Reflect on that experience and answer the following questions like you would in an interview:

### Questions you need to answer

1. How did you work with another team member to deliver a feature in these last 6 weeks? What roles have you played?

	I am pretty sure for far I am doing pretty well, all they way up we are working through ZOOM and discuss every questions we have had, during all this 6 weeks we did quite good progress and keep growing as a team and close to finishing our project


2. What did you learn from working in a team these last 6 weeks? How are you going to improve your teamwork in the future?

	Honestly I have learned a lot, I am keep improving my developer skills, team player skills, I am definitely sure all this skills will help me in my future job. Overall Lambda School have teach me working in team and be really open to people
